Jazz Chord Substitutor is a single-page web app built to
aid in learning and writing music that includes chord 
substitutions. JCS uses a simple algorithm to load similar 
chord types to those you have entered and allows you to 
switch chords on the fly and listen to the result.

Playing 8 bars of C Major? JCS will let you know that you 
may consider also playing Cmaj7, Cmaj6, C7, C9, Em7, Am7, 
etc...

Jazz Chord Substitutor was created by Steve Rubinstein 
while he was a student at Fullstack Academy in New York.
It was built on the MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, 
Node) using the Angular Fullstack Generator. It uses
Audiolet to interact with the Web Audio API.
